# Agent Engineering Bootcamp - Knowledge Base

This is a sample document for testing the RAG system document upload functionality.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful AI technique that combines:

1. **Information Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. **Text Generation**: Using an LLM to generate responses based on retrieved context
3. **Context Integration**: Combining retrieved information with user queries

## Key Benefits of RAG

- **Accuracy**: Responses are grounded in actual data
- **Up-to-date**: Can include recent information not in the LLM's training
- **Transparency**: Sources can be cited and verified
- **Customization**: Works with domain-specific knowledge

## Technical Architecture

```
User Query → Vector Search → Retrieve Documents → LLM Generation → Response
```

## Agent Engineering Bootcamp Topics

### Week 1: Foundation
- Setting up development environment
- Understanding LLMs and APIs
- Building first AI agent

### Week 2: RAG Systems
- Document processing and embedding
- Vector databases (Vectorize, Pinecone)
- Retrieval strategies

### Week 3: Advanced Agents
- Function calling
- Multi-step reasoning
- Agent orchestration

### Week 4: Production
- Error handling and monitoring
- Scaling and optimization
- Deployment strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Document Chunking**: Split large documents appropriately
2. **Metadata**: Include relevant metadata for filtering
3. **Embedding Quality**: Use appropriate embedding models
4. **Evaluation**: Test retrieval quality regularly

## Common Use Cases

- Customer support chatbots
- Internal knowledge assistants
- Research and analysis tools
- Documentation Q&A systems
